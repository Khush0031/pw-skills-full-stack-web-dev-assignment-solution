### Short Note On Tag and Elements With Example
- **What is a Tag.**
    - HTML uses a system of "tags" to define the structure and layout of web pages. Tags are the building blocks of
HTML documents and consist of angle brackets enclosing specific keywords. These tags provide instructions
to web browsers on how to display the content.  

    - An HTML tag is composed of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. The opening tag starts with
the less-than symbol (<), followed by the tag name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing
tag is similar, but it also includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name.  
    - For example:  
        - Opening tag: <>
        - Closing tag: </>  

- **HTML tags can be broadly categorised into two types:**  
    - **1. Paired Tags** (or Container Tags):  

        - Paired tags have both an opening and a closing tag and can contain other HTML elements and text within
        them. They define a specific section or structure in the web page.

    - **2. Singular Tags** (or Void Tags):  

        - In HTML, some are self-closing tags or void tags because they don't require a separate closing tag. These
            elements are used for elements that don't contain any content or don't have a closing counterpart.

- **What is a Element.**  
    - **HTML elements** are the building blocks of an HTML document. HTML elements consist of a start tag, an end
tag (if applicable), and content in between the tags. The start tag defines the beginning of an HTML
element, and the end tag defines the end of an HTML element.  

    - Each HTML element has a specific structure that defines its behaviour and appearance on a web page.
      **Here is a breakdown of the anatomy of an HTML element:**  

        - **1. Opening tag** - This is the opening tag that defines the beginning of an HTML element. It is enclosed in
                                angle brackets (< >)  

        - **2. Content** - This is the text or other data that appears between the start and end tags of an HTML element.  
                            Some HTML elements do not require content and are self-closing
        
        - **3. Closing tag** - This is the closing tag that defines the end of an HTML element. It is enclosed in angle
                                brackets with a forward slash (/) before the element name.
