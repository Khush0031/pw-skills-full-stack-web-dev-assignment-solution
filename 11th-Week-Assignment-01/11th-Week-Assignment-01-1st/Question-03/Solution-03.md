# Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

In JavaScript, primitive data types are simple data types that represent single values. They are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once they are created. Here are the five primitive data types in JavaScript:

1. **String:**
   - Represents textual data.
   - Enclosed in single (''), double ("") or backticks (``) quotes.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let greeting = "Hello, World!";
     ```

2. **Number:**
   - Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let age = 25;
     let pi = 3.14;
     ```

3. **Boolean:**
   - Represents a logical entity, either `true` or `false`.
   - Used for making decisions and comparisons.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let isRaining = true;
     let isSunny = false;
     ```

4. **Null:**
   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value or no value at all.
   - It is a special keyword.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let absentValue = null;
     ```

5. **Undefined:**
   - Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
   - It is a primitive value and also a type.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let undefinedVariable;
     ```

These primitive data types are the building blocks for more complex data structures in JavaScript. It's important to note that primitive values are passed by value, meaning the actual value is passed, and any changes made to the parameter do not affect the original variable.
